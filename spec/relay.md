# Relay Protocol

Relay is a zero-knowledge message transport boundary. It authenticates relay
access, routes opaque envelopes, stores offline queues, and emits relay receipts.

## REST API

- `GET /.well-known/iscp/relay`
- `POST /v2/relay/devices/bind-self`
- `POST /v2/relay/devices/register-with-ticket`
- `POST /v2/relay/devices/refresh-access`
- `POST /v2/relay/devices/revoke-access`
- `POST /v2/relay/envelopes`
- `GET /v2/relay/admin/devices`
- `GET /v2/relay/admin/connections`
- `GET /v2/relay/admin/messages`

Optional device lifecycle endpoints, offered by deployments that operate the
relay and trust root together and advertised via relay descriptor `metadata`
capability keys (see spec/device-lifecycle.md):

- `POST /v2/relay/devices/renew-grant` (optional)
- `POST /v2/relay/devices/auto-renew-grant` (optional)
- `POST /v2/relay/devices/recover-credentials` (optional)
- `POST /v2/relay/devices/repair-recovery-anchor` (optional)

`bind-self` is the first-device bootstrap transport and is actor-authorized:
production deployments MUST gate it behind an external actor authorization in
addition to the device proof (spec/provisioning.md).

`register-with-ticket` consumes a signed pairing ticket. Production
deployments MUST require the full signed `iscp.pairing_ticket.v3` object,
verify its signature against the Trust Root, and require the device proof
challenge to equal the `ticket_id`; accepting a bare ticket identifier with a
self-reported challenge is a local-lab behavior. Ticket consumption enforces
the grant role invariants defined in spec/provisioning.md, including rejecting
consumption by the ticket's `grant_audience`.

Production Relay envelope submission requires both a bearer access credential
and proof of possession in `X-ISCP-Access-Proof`. The proof is a base64url
encoded `iscp.device.proof.v2` over this challenge:

```text
iscp/v2/relay/access-proof || NUL || METHOD || NUL || PATH || NUL || access_token_sha256_base64url
```

The proof audience is the Relay ID. The proof nonce is replay-protected.

## WebSocket API

- `GET /v2/relay/connect`

Connection state:

```text
CONNECTED -> CHALLENGE_SENT -> POP_VERIFIED -> READY -> CLOSED
```

Business envelopes are accepted only in READY state. Relay receipt confirms
relay handling only and does not imply E2E application receipt.
